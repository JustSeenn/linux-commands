# Adding a User

To add a new user to your Linux server, use the adduser command as follows:

```bash
sudo adduser <username>
```
Follow the prompts to set a password and fill in any other requested information (full name, phone number, etc.).

To give the user administrator privileges (sudo), add them to the sudo group using the usermod command:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo <username>
```
## Troubleshooting
### Cannot lock /etc/passwd

If you receive this error when attempting to add a user, it means that the /etc/passwd file is currently locked by another process and the adduser command cannot access it. Here's how to fix this issue:

- Try running the adduser command again in a few minutes. If the file was temporarily locked by another process, it should be available again after a while.
- Check if another process is currently modifying the /etc/passwd file using the command lsof /etc/passwd. If you find a suspicious process, try stopping it using the kill command followed by the process number.
- If the file is permanently locked and you cannot find any processes that might be responsible, it is possible that the file is damaged. You will need to repair or replace it with a backup copy.
- If you are still unable to resolve the issue, you can try temporarily disabling SELinux by modifying the /etc/selinux/config configuration file and setting the SELINUX value to disabled. Restart your server and try adding the user again. Don't forget to re-enable SELinux once you are finished.


### Cannot create directory '/home/<username>': Permission denied
This error occurs if the system doesn't have permission to create the user's home directory. 
To fix it you can :
 - Choose a different location for the user's home directory. By default, the adduser command creates the home directory in the /home directory, but you can specify a different location using the --home option. For example:
```bash
sudo adduser --home /path/to/home/directory <username>
```
- Run the adduser command with sudo. This will give the command the necessary permissions to create the user's home directory.

- Check the permissions on the /home directory. The adduser command needs write permission on the /home directory in order to create the user's home directory. If the permissions are not set correctly, you can use the chmod command to change them. For example:
```bash
sudo chmod 755 /home
```
This will give the adduser command the necessary permissions to create the user's home directory in the /home directory.

If you are still unable to add the user, it is possible that there is a problem with the file system or with the system itself. In this case, you may need to seek further assistance or consult your system logs to identify the cause of the issue.
